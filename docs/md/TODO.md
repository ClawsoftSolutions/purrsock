# TODO and Ideas for Purrsock

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] **Error Translation Layer**: Add a layer to translate platform-specific errors (like WSAGetLastError) to cross-platform error codes.
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Provide optional logging hooks for debugging network operations.
- [ ] **Custom Callbacks**: Allow users to register error handling callbacks for more dynamic behavior.

## 2. Serialization and Deserialization
- [ ] **Data Serialization**: Add utilities for serializing and deserializing data (e.g., JSON, binary formats).
- [ ] **Stream Support**: Support handling continuous data streams, including chunk-based processing.

## 3. Asynchronous and Non-blocking Operations
- [ ] **Async Support**: Add support for asynchronous socket operations using threads or a platform-independent event loop.
- [ ] **Non-blocking API**: Provide a non-blocking API for better control in game servers or real-time applications.
- [ ] **Timeout Management**: Allow users to specify timeouts for blocking operations.

## 4. Advanced Protocols
- [ ] **TLS/SSL Support**: Add support for encrypted connections (e.g., through OpenSSL or similar libraries).
- [ ] **WebSocket Protocol**: Implement WebSocket support for modern web-based applications.
- [ ] **Multicast and Broadcast**: Enable multicast/broadcast support for group communication.

## 5. Utility Features
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for efficient resource management in client-server setups.
- [ ] **Heartbeat/Keepalive Mechanism**: Add built-in heartbeat to maintain long-lived connections.
- [ ] **DNS Lookup**: Provide utilities for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

## 6. Performance Enhancements
- [ ] **Packet Batching**: Implement packet batching to reduce the number of individual send/receive calls.
- [ ] **Zero-copy I/O**: Use platform-specific APIs for zero-copy data transmission (e.g., sendfile on Linux).
- [ ] **Event-driven Architecture**: Add support for efficient event-based models using epoll (Linux) or IOCP (Windows).

## 7. Security Features
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Provide strict validation for input data to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to protect against DoS attacks.
- [ ] **Encryption Helpers**: Provide easy-to-use helpers for encrypted payloads.

## 8. Debugging and Diagnostics
- [ ] **Traffic Monitor**: Add tools to monitor and log traffic for debugging purposes.
- [ ] **Packet Sniffer**: Allow users to capture and inspect packets (great for development).
- [ ] **Connection Statistics**: Expose APIs to monitor stats like bandwidth usage, packet loss, etc.

## 9. Cross-platform Enhancements
- [ ] **Platform Detection**: Improve platform abstraction to make the library work seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- [ ] **IPv6 Support**: Add full support for IPv6 to future-proof the library.

## 10. High-level Abstractions
- [ ] **HTTP/HTTPS Support**: Provide utilities for making HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- [ ] **RPC Framework**: Add remote procedure call (RPC) support for simplified distributed communication.
- [ ] **Pub/Sub Model**: Add support for publish/subscribe communication patterns.

## 11. Extensibility and Modularity
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Create a plugin system to let users extend functionality without modifying the core.
- [ ] **Custom Protocol Support**: Make it easy for developers to implement custom protocols over sockets.

## 12. Testing and Examples
- [ ] **Mock Networking**: Add support for mock sockets for unit testing without real network dependencies.
- [ ] **Example Applications**: Expand the example directory with diverse use cases, such as chat servers, file transfers, etc.

## 13. Configuration and Ease of Use
- [ ] **Configurable Timeouts**: Let users set connection and read/write timeouts globally or per socket.
- [ ] **Reusable Packets**: Allow packet buffers to be reused to reduce memory allocations.
- [ ] **Fluent API Design**: Make APIs intuitive with chaining for common operations.
